<h1>Data Scraping Houston</h1>
<h3>A coding challenge for OccasionGenius</h3>


<h4>About</h4>

<p>Data Scraping Houston is a coding challenge with multiple stages of difficulty. Utilizing Apify SDK and Nodejs, the files within the challenges directory will retrieve scraped data from the Houston events website (https://www.visithoustontexas.com/events/).</p>
  
  <h4>The following objectives from the challenges have been completed successfully:</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>Scrape the Zumba data and parse into an events object</li>
  <li>Scrape the events page to paginate through and collect the URLs</li>
  <li>Parse through a list of URLs and scrape multiple pages enqueued</li>
</ul>

  <h4>The following objectives from the challenges have not been completed:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Paginate and scrape automation</li>
  <li>Moment.js date formatting</li>
</ul>




<h4>How to operate</h4>

<p>Download the repo and ensure all dependencies are installed. After this, run "npm run cX" in the command line where X is equal to the challenge number you want preformed.</p>

<p>Note: Apify CLI is not being implemented, and there is no 'purge' command. Before each run, delete all key_value_stores and datasets from the apify_storage directory.</p>


<h4>Take Aways</h4>

<p>This coding challenge was fun, as web scraping allows you to play the part of a detective in fetching the proper data. While having some experience with Cheerio, the chance to see scraping automation completed was incredibly rewarding. Having a weekd to learn, digest and utilize a new SDK was focus fuel and kept me incredibly engaged. Three big take aways from the challenge as a whole are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>STAY POSITIVE</strong> - On my first day I felt incredibly confident, I was able to implement some things I had learned from self-teaching myself through web development, and I had a lot of momentum going into the rest of the project. Around day three is when I felt defeated and overwhelmed, starting to work on the pagination challenge. I felt like I didn't know what I was doing, and ultimately wasting my time. After a deep breath, I told myself to take a break and started to talk myself through being positive. Sure enough, when I came back the next day, the code suddenly "clicked" in my head, and I was able to make progress. Whenever I felt defeated, I just affirmed myself to staying positive, and made steps of progress every day.</li>
  <li><strong>GET IT WORKING</strong> - I have allowed myself to be too bogged down on projects, getting lost in the weeds of making something look pretty, when ultimately I should be focused on getting it working. I took the challenge literally, and understanding that this was to engage others with a demo, I made it a priority to stay focused on the tasks at hand.</li>
  <li><strong>APIFY IS PRETTY COOL</strong> - The SDK is incredibly simple to get going in, and there are plenty of options to customize the scrapes. What is even cooler is I listened to a podcast interviewing Jan ÄŒurn(founder and CEO of Apify), where he discussed the desire to create a tool to open information up on the internet. Jan talked at length about how his goal was to make information on the internet less hidden and to utilize what is the largest database in human history. The tools available are one thing, but knowing the meaning behind them is incredibly inspiring.</li>
